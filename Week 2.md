| Colour Palette | This week was in charge of deciding which UI and UX designs I'll be implementing on the website. I first decided a colour palette on Coolers that would be used in the main menus and brand logo of my website - which I decided to be quite minimalistic (black, white, grey) as that was the whole goal of my application. | [Colour palette link](https://coolors.co/fffcf2-ccc5b9-403d39-252422)<br><img width="300" alt="Image of Colour Palette (Coolers)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69d6dbc0-5118-41bc-97f6-fb78de170961" /> |
| Typography     | On top of that, I also decided on my final typography, which I'll be downloading from DaFont. | [Font Link](https://www.dafont.com/super-frosting.font)<br><img width="300" alt="Image of final font" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435bf111-968c-40c4-ab76-914b645ce284" /> |
| Logos          | Icon and image choices were made in Canva (where I could adjust different parts of the logo to suit/fit into my colour palette) which can be seen:<br>*Images will be PNG files with background removed on the application* | <img width="200" alt="Image of finalised logo 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbc71401-258e-44bc-9a42-acd137c89158" /><br><img width="200" alt="Image of finalised logo 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2194246-6be5-408c-bdd3-81a4fc124f66" /> |

**Navigation**: My app is mainly a productivity-focused app that helps users manage time with customisable pomodoro timers, inspirational quotes, music and backgrounds. The design is minimalistic and user-centered with user assessibility being a main focus in my wireframe. Users start on a Login page with inputs for email, password and captcha for additional account security. If the user doesn't have an account yet, theres a button to press on the main screen that links to 'Create an Account' which includes a sign up page with email, password and password confirmation. After logging in, users are directed to the Default/Home Screen (clock). After the log in process, main navigation options can be seen from the home screen, which includes clock (home), pomodoro, a timer, music (where users can choose their background noise or music) and settings (log out, background and alarm sound once the timer is done). Navigation in my app will be icon based, where it is located on the top right of the app interface.

**Interactive elements** 
| Elements             | Details                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Random quotes       | New quote appears each time the screen loads or at timed intervals |
| Music player        | Play/pause functionality plus song selection       |
| Full screen option  | Likely on clock screen for distraction-free mode    |
| Switch modes        | Switch to different modes using the icons at the top|


**Branding**: The name "studo!" is consistently displayed in the top-left of each screen and acts as both a logo and home button. I decided on the minimalist aesthetic (black/white/grey) as it suits as a productivity scheme and paired along with the inspirational quotes and calming music, reflects the app's purpose on focusing, calming and motivating yourself to study.

**Forms**: Forms on my application are relatively simple; just the login/sign up forms where the inputs are email, password (+ confirm password on sign up) as well as a Captcha field for security. On both starting pages, there will be links linking the two with lines such as "Create account" or "Already have an account?".

**Logos & Buttons**: 
Buttons on each screen:
| Buttons               | What it does                                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Login/Signup  | Submit form and link to home screen                              |
| Timer Screen    | Start / pause / reset the pomodoro timer                                |
| Settings Buttons       | Change default Pomodoro session time and break times |
| Music Controls        | Choose from background noise (eg. lake, cafe)                   |
| Alarms                | Add new alarms                                                    |
| Background Selector   | Chosen from various high-quality 4K still images websites (ensuring they're non-copyright)                |
