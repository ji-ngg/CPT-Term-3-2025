## Week 2; Wireframing & Designing the Application
# UI Choices & Designs

This week was in charge of deciding which UI and UX designs I'll be implementing on the website. I first decided a colour palette on Coolers that would be used in the main menus and brand logo of my website - which I decided to be quite minimalistic (black, white, grey) as that was the whole goal of my application.

On top of that, I also decided on my final typography I'll be using on the app on DaFont. [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/super-frosting.font)

Icon and image choices were made in Canva (where I could adjust different parts of the logo to suit/fit into my colour palette) which can be seen:
