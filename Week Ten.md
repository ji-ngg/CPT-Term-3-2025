## Adding Interactivity (cont.)
Continuing from last week, I started adding buttons and other interactive elements into my website. However, I didn't get as far as what I had hoped because I went on vacation :(

I caught up on week ten work and when I tested my website it was all working fine - during the holidays I will refine my CSS and make sure everything is to design. Currently, my website is looking like the default one that was provided but different layout and not to my plan. 

To do during holidays:
Refine CSS
Change all the font colours to what was on layout
Add the images
Import sound and background music -> code into the website
Set up log in & sign up database and code

## **Work during the holidays**
During the holidays, I created the log in and sign up page as well as set up the SQL database. I then linked this to my `data_source.db` and `my_queries.sql` where examples of user's data is shown below:

<img width="852" height="148" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-14 at 4 10 02â€¯pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5320950a-9429-43a2-a54d-7e194b3a5a9b" />

Studo will save the user's saved preferences for background sound and music, as well as their preferred background (which I have edited from the original plan to just different pastel colours since having high quality normal pictures will interfere with the readability of the text on page).

I've also finalised and shortened my code for my CSS styling of the website (shown below). While working on this code, I came across many error 403 messages which upon further researching was telling me how the website was restricted (most likely because I was having trouble with the reCAPTCHA account system which was reading it as incompleted); however, this was fixed by watching some video tutorials and asking AI for extra tutorials for how to link between my `style.css` and `app.js`
