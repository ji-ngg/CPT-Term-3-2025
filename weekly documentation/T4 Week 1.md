## Finalising the project
This week was finalising everything to submit
- Finalised adding reCAPTCHA to my log-in and sign-up pages where I ran into many issues where the localhost wasn't detecting on my domain. This was fixed by researching answers from people who ran into the same issues previously (I ended up fixing this by implementing the localhost link instead of just the words on Google Cloud Services).
- Other than that, I also centred the main boxes in CSS and made sure that everything was running smoothly. Also added background music but due to overlaps in code which were unable to be fixed (I don't know why but every time I added a new background music, the webpage would shut down and deny me access to the website). As a result, I resorted to just having rain noises and having that as a seperate button on the site.

Also generated a Google Lighthouse report where scores are shown below: I'll aim to increase these scores before submission

Also double-checked for offline functionality where the website fully works but reCAPTCHA prevents users from visiting the other HTMLs beside log in/sign up :)
