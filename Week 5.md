## Week 5; Setting up for development and SQL System
This week was placing all the folders into VSC and coding the neccessary queries and tables that will help with the SQL database. We were asked to make test data to check that the structure works.

Some errors that I ran into this week was the importing the folders when I imported multiple folders by accident and not following the document structure given to us - which I've fixed upon realising. All the folders are now successfully working and I can get started coding the actual application.
