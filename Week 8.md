## Creating and Styling your Webpages (HTML and CSS)
This week was focused on designing the website and styling it for my client to use, where my goal was to make it accessible to everyone yet not too plain.
- chose new font because once the old font was uploaded, the invisible unicode popped up showing invisible characters
- ran into some issues with the ports, changed from 5000 to 5100
- code kept on breaking when adding new hmtls but is now fixed

My website right now has working and connected webpages, however I will need to change the font and also add the information on all pages which I'll be focused on next week
