This week was spent with me experimenting with different designs of my application. I first started off with finding a new colour palette, which was also done on Coolers [Click here for the link](https://coolors.co/2b2d42-8d99ae-edf2f4), to fit into the minimalist design.

**Other changed features**

| Feature                | Old Design            | New Design        |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Colour scheme       | Lighter colours  (beige, white and brown)   | Still light colours, chose blue for a calming sense  |
| Typography        | Typography from original design          | Kept the same because it suited the logo font :)    |
| Logo        | Made on Canva with original colours     | Edited in Canva to match the new colour palette   |
| Logo position (login and signup)    | Positioned on the top of the page  | Much larger, moved to the side  |
| Menu icons        | In a separate menu (icons instead of the side menu)     | Changed to small buttons on the top right |
| Full screen button    | On the bottom left        | Moved to the bottoom right  |
| Music and settings    | On the bottom of the site      | Also moved to the top right   |

# User data flow
Data flow incorporated on my website:
- Login: email & password, then verifies credentials and redirects to the mainboard
- Signup: first name, email and password, user data gets stored and redirects to dashboard
- Clock page: displays the time (fetched from system) and a generated inspirational quote
- Pomodoro page: displays the current break duration (short break, long break and study), user name is displayed with the quote (eg. you can do it [name]!) name is collected from the sign up/account data, the time is tracked and resets accordingly
- Timer page: countdown timer, data is retrieved from users keyboard for the duration of the timer
- Settings: select background noise (eg. white noise or rain), users choose music and all sounds are looped and can be played simultaneously
- Alarms and displays: set pomodoro alarm durations, choose 12/24 hour time formats and change the visual backgrounds.
- There's a link on the general settings that directs users to a feedback survey to help improve the website further
