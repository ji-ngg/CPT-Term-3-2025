## CPT-Term-3-2025
# Week 1; Rough ideas for the website
Ideas for website/app
1. Mental health tracker (people put mood on everyday, can see what their past moods are)
2. Dog walker finder
3. Carpool finder
**4. Study timer & focus tracker**
5. Homework tracker
6. A random timer where people can set time, name & put random icons on their stuff

# Functional Requirements
The app is mainly going to be used for studying purposes and will feature a main timer with different options that the user can choose instead such as a Pomodoro timer and normal clock.

# Non-functional Requirements
Users will be able to choose backgrounds, the sound when the timer has finished, the times of the breaks/study periods of each session for the timer & pomodoro etc. App will be very customisable if time is allowed. Inspirational quotes will be shown on a randomly generated basis which users can opt to turn off. Music will also be added (probably just some rain or white noise) which users can choose to turn off or on.
