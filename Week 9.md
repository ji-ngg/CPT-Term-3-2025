## Adding Interactivity
This week was focused on adding interactivity (such as buttons or interactive elements) into my website. I didn't do much work this week but I did end up with a functioning clock which I coded using Javascript. Next week, I'll focus on changing the fonts throughout my website (as my font is custom downloaded which I will need to upload into VSC first).
