## Adding Interactivity
This week was focused on adding interactivity (such as buttons or interactive elements) into my website. I didn't do much work this week but I did end up with a functioning clock which I coded using Javascript. Next week, I'll focus on changing the fonts throughout my website (as my font is custom downloaded which I will need to upload into VSC first). THough I haven't finished much of the interactivy component, I have added a `serviceworker.js` and `manifest.json`. Next week will also be focusing on the Google Lighthouse reports and finding any bugs within my code.
